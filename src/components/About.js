				<h2>about:</h2>
				hi! we're irith and irika katiyar, 17 year old twins from california who love to code! we both have been coding since we were in 7th grade. 
				we have taken ap computer science and are on the silver level of the USA Computing Olympiad! in the future, we both plan on pursuing computational biology
				to combine our interest for biology and computer science. besides java, we also know web development, and this whole website was created from scratch 
				by both of us!<br/><br/>

				<b>a little more about irika:</b><br/>
				my name is irika, and i'm the older twin (by 30 seconds, every second counts!) the programming languages i know are java, html, 
				css, and javascript. other than coding, i love to play squash, do bollywood dance, play guitar, sing, bike, travel, write children's books 
				(search up my name on amazon), and make animated videos (check out 2MinuteBio on youtube). i also love watching netflix, making random videos on imovie, 
				and haging out with friends!<br/><br/>

				<b> a little more about irith:</b><br/>
				my name is irith, and i'm the younger twin, something irika never fails to remind me about. the programming languages i know are java, html, 
				css, javascript, swift, and python. i love to make apps (check out appchapp.com) and have a few on the app store. you can also find me on Juni 
				Learning's blog and youtube channel. other than coding, i love to play squash, do bollywood dance, play mario kart, binge watch netflix 
				(black mirror is my all time favorite show), and meet new people. <br/><br/>

				<b>special thanks to:</b><br/>
				ruby for teaching us coding and helping us a lot in creating this website! :)
